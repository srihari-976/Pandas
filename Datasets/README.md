# Datasets for Pandas Tutorials

Welcome to the Datasets section of the Pandas tutorial repository. This directory contains various datasets used for illustrating and practicing data manipulation and analysis using Pandas. Each dataset is provided in a convenient format, such as CSV, to facilitate easy loading and analysis.


## Usage
You can load these datasets into a Pandas DataFrame using the pd.read_csv() function. Here's an example of how to load the Titanic dataset:

```sh
import pandas as pd
```

# Load the Titanic dataset
```sh
df = pd.read_csv('Datasets/ipl2024 Matches.csv')
```

# Display the first few rows of the DataFrame
```sh
print(df.head())
```

Feel free to explore the datasets and use them for your learning and projects. The datasets are ideal for practicing data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and more.
